The program basically reads the program files per line
and then it compares each line from prog 1 and 2 with
each other and if they are the same, assign it to the
longest same string and if a longer same string occurs
after, then simply replace it.

Then to get the percentage, I just got the ratio of the
same number of lines to the total number of lines to 
indicate the similarity percentage.
